### World of Water Towers Memory Game
This is a front-end React application inspired by the fascination I developed with water towers on my first cross-country road trip from Missouri to California. 

The player clicks an image to score a point, but must remember not to click the same image twice or else they lose the game and the score resets to zero. The task is made more difficult for the player as the images shuffle randomly after each click.
